        <cite>6 PM - March 16, 2024</cite>
        <p>
          Today, I mostly worked on homework and also spent time with my
          girlfriend. I ate breakfast tacos and nothing else so I am really
          hungry. Tonight, I plan to hang out with some friends and play poker

        <p>
          I finally got a dog. I been waiting my whole life for this. I traveled
          to Brenham, TX, which is about 90 minutes from where I live in Austin,
          and I met and took home my new best friend. His name is Melo and he is
          a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. He is a tiny baby right now, but one day he
          will be big and strong

        <h2>Life in Austin</h2>
        <cite>9 PM - January 12, 2023</cite>
        <p>
          Austin Texas is one of the best American cities. From a killer BBQ and
          Tex Mex food culture, to live music and rockin bars, Austin is
          awesome. Sometimes, it gets a little too hot, but it does not matter
          because we are always having fun.
