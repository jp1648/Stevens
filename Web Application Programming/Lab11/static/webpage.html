<!-- 
Static HTML file 

Your page should have a few basic user interface elements:
-A header tag, with an h1 naming your site, with a title for your page
-A footer with your name, student ID, and any other info about yourself you wish to include
-An empty unordered list with an id of showList that is initially hidden.  
-A div with an id of show that is initially hidden.
-A form with an id of searchForm.
-A text input with an id of search_term.
-A label with a for attribute referencing your input
-A button to submit the form
-A link that links back to the "/" route with the text "Back to All Shows" and that has an id of homeLink 
  -This link will initially be hidden
  -It will ONLY be displayed when the show element is being displayed or ONLY when a search is performed and search results are being displayed
  -You should NOT show this link on the initial show list
  -This link will simply trigger a reload of the page, which then will display the initial list of shows
